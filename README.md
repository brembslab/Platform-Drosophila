# Platform-Drosophila
Scripts of analysing the results from Drosophila walking in the platform with optogenetics

The input file consists of a .dat file that results from the custom software written in (Visual Basics?) for this experiment.

You just need to start the script "mainplatform.r" and it will source the other scripts.
